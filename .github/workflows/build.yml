# The peculiarity of this workflow is that assumes vcpkg is NOT stored as a submodule of this repository.
# This workflow does the following:
# - Restores vcpkg artifacts from cache.
# - Using the provided Git commit id, sets up vcpkg if needed, then run CMake with CMakePreset.json using a configuration
#   that leverages the vcpkg's toolchain file. This will automatically run vcpkg to install dependencies
#   described by the vcpkg.json manifest file. It will be a no-op if those are restored from cache.
# - Finally builds the sources with Ninja.
